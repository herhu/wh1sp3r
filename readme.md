# 🚀 Whisper Lambda Transcription Service

Welcome to the Whisper Lambda deployment for real-time freestyle transcription! This guide documents what we built, how it works, and what comes next.

---

## ✨ Overview

We created a serverless transcription service using OpenAI's Whisper model deployed on AWS Lambda using a Docker container. The endpoint supports audio file uploads and returns the transcribed text.

---

## 🚧 Tech Stack

* **AWS Lambda** with container image (Python 3.10)
* **FastAPI** for request routing
* **Mangum** for ASGI -> Lambda adapter
* **Whisper** model (`small`) for transcription
* **CloudWatch** for logs and monitoring
* **ECR** for container storage
* **Function URL** for direct HTTP access
* **Warm-up scripts** to avoid cold starts

---

## 📃 What We Did

### 1. **Built Docker Lambda container**

* Installed Whisper + dependencies + ffmpeg via static tar.
* Avoided large layer constraints by using `public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10` base image.

### 2. **Optimized model loading**

* Introduced a simple model router with fallback to `small`.
* Cached model in memory to reduce load times.

### 3. **Logging & Debugging**

* Added detailed logs: incoming request, working dir, file size, path, and final transcription.

### 4. **Handled file system issues**

* Ensured temp files were written inside `/tmp` (Lambda's writable dir).

### 5. **Implemented warm-up**

* Used `warmup_lambda.sh` with CloudWatch + lightweight Lambda + scheduled pings.

### 6. **Enabled public access**

* Created a Lambda Function URL with `AuthType=NONE`.
* Configured IAM policy to allow invocation.

### 7. **Tested successfully**

* Audio (10s) uploaded via `curl`
* Whisper model correctly loaded and transcribed in \~10s

## 🎓 Example Usage

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-lambda-url>/transcribe \
  -F "file=@sample_1.wav" \
  -F "user_id=hernan" \
  -F "model_type=internal" \
  -F "language=es"
```

## 🚀 What's Next

### ✅ Immediate Goals

* [x] Fix all bugs and deployment issues
* [x] Ensure full pipeline works end-to-end

### ⚖️ Benchmarking & Cost Analysis

* Use CloudWatch metrics to measure average duration
* Estimate monthly cost based on concurrency and usage
* Tune memory vs. time tradeoff

### 📊 Optimization Ideas

* Chunk long audio to reduce memory and cost
* Compress input if possible
* Introduce tiered model selection (`tiny`, `base`, etc.)
* Cache transcription segments across requests (if reused)

## 🎉 Congrats

You just deployed Whisper transcription serverless at scale. We now have:

* Fast & secure file upload endpoint
* Real-time inference
* Observability with logs
* Configurable model paths

Well done! 🌟
